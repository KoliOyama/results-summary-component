## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This Challenge was a great learning experience for me. I mastered the use of custom properties to avoid code repetition and improve readability. I also gained more confidence in creating responsive layouts with grid, flexbox, and media queries.



### Continued development

I plan to explore more media queries and their applications in different scenarios. I'm also curious about the clamp function and how it can simplify my code and enhance my designs.
